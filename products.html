                        <p>Almond milk is one of the most popular dairy alternatives, and for good reason. Made from finely
                            ground almonds and water, our almond milk is creamy, delicious, and packed with nutrients...</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Nutritional Benefits:</strong> Almond milk is rich in vitamin E, which is an
                                antioxidant
                                that supports skin health and the immune system. It’s also low in calories and fat, making
                                it a
                                fantastic choice for anyone looking to reduce their calorie intake. Our almond milk is
                                fortified
                                with calcium and other essential vitamins, ensuring you get the nutrients you need for bone
                                health, heart health, and overall wellness.</li>

                                gluten-free,

                                plant-based diet or simply avoiding dairy, almond milk is the perfect addition to your
                                smoothies, cereal, coffee, or just as a refreshing drink on its own.</li>

                    <h3>Oat Milk – Naturally Sweet, Smooth, and Versatile</h3>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Oat milk has quickly become a fan favorite for its naturally sweet flavor and creamy consistency.
                            Made from whole oats, our oat milk provides a nutritious, dairy-free alternative that’s rich in
                            fiber and plant-based protein.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Nutritional Benefits:</strong> Oat milk is an excellent source of beta-glucan, a
                                type of
                                soluble fiber that helps regulate cholesterol levels and supports heart health. It’s also
                                fortified with calcium, vitamin D, and other essential nutrients that support bone health
                                and
                                immune function. Our oat milk offers a smooth and satisfying texture, making it perfect for
                                lattes, smoothies, and baking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dietary Compatibility:</strong> Our oat milk is 100% vegan, lactose-free, and
                                gluten-free, so it fits easily into various dietary lifestyles, from vegans to those with
                                gluten
                                sensitivities. With its naturally creamy texture and mild sweetness, oat milk is ideal for
                                coffee lovers and anyone looking for a plant-based beverage that’s rich in nutrients.</li>

                            <li><strong>Nutritional Benefits:</strong> Nut milk blends are high in plant-based protein and
                                healthy fats, such as those found in almonds and cashews, which support heart health, brain
                                function, and skin health. They’re also naturally rich in antioxidants, like vitamin E, and
                                fortified with calcium and other essential nutrients. These blends offer a diverse range of

                    <h3>Specialty Plant-Based Milks – For Every Taste</h3>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>At The Nutr, we don’t just stop at almond and oat milk. We’re always innovating to bring you new,
                            exciting plant-based milk options that cater to different tastes and dietary needs. Our
                            specialty
                            plant-based milks include options like hemp milk, coconut milk, and macadamia milk—each crafted
                            with
                            unique ingredients to provide variety and exceptional taste.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Nutritional Benefits:</strong> Specialty milks like hemp milk and coconut milk offer
                                their own set of benefits. Hemp milk is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, which support
                                brain and heart health. Coconut milk, on the other hand, is rich in medium-chain
                                triglycerides
                                (MCTs), which may help boost metabolism and promote healthy energy levels. Each specialty
                                milk
                                is packed with the nutrients your body needs while offering a distinctive flavor that makes
                                every sip enjoyable.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dietary Compatibility:</strong> As with all of our plant-based milks, these
                                specialty
                                options are vegan, lactose-free, and gluten-free, ensuring that they can fit seamlessly into
                                any
                                dietary lifestyle. Whether you’re using coconut milk in your curries, hemp milk in your
                                smoothies, or simply enjoying macadamia milk in your coffee, these plant-based options add
                                diversity to your diet without compromising on health or taste.</li>
                        </ul>
