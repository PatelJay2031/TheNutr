                        <h2>Why Choose Plant-Based Milk?</h2>
                        <p>The shift toward plant-based milk is not just a trend—it’s a conscious choice that aligns
                            with healthier living and environmental responsibility. At The Nutr, we offer a variety of
                            plant-based
                            milks that deliver the best of both worlds: great taste and optimal nutrition. Our almond
                            milk, oat
                            milk, and nut milk are carefully crafted to be more than just an alternative to dairy;
                            they’re a step
                            toward a healthier, more sustainable future.</p>

                <h3>Nutritional Benefits of Plant-Based Milk</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dairy-Free & Lactose-Free:</strong> Plant-based milk is naturally dairy-free, making it
                        a fantastic option for individuals with lactose intolerance or dairy sensitivities.</li>
                    <li><strong>High in Protein:</strong> Our almond milk, oat milk, and nut milk are great sources of
                        plant-based protein, essential for muscle growth, tissue repair, and overall health.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vitamins & Minerals:</strong> Rich in vitamin E, calcium, and magnesium—essential for
                        healthy bones, immune support, and heart health.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low in Calories & Fat:</strong> Ideal for reducing calorie intake, with oat milk being
                        naturally sweet and creamy but lower in fat than dairy milk.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Artificial Additives:</strong> Free from artificial preservatives, colors, and
                        flavors, ensuring every sip is fresh and wholesome.</li>
                </ul>

                        <h3>The Environmental Advantages of Plant-Based Milk</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Lower Carbon Footprint:</strong> Plant-based milks like almond milk and oat milk
                                have a fraction of the carbon footprint of cow’s milk.</li>
                            <li><strong>Water Conservation:</strong> Oat milk uses significantly less water than dairy
                                milk, helping to conserve this vital resource.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sustainable Farming Practices:</strong> Our ingredients come from farms
                                practicing
                                responsible, eco-friendly techniques that protect soil health and promote biodiversity.
